    "# Exercise 2: Measurement Error Mitigation\n",
    "\n",
    "Present day quantum computers are subject to noise of various kinds. The principle behind error mitigation is to reduce the effects from a specific source of error.  Here we will look at mitigating measurement errors, i.e., errors in determining the correct quantum state from measurements performed on qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"mitigation.png\" width=\"900\"/>\n",
    "<center>Measurement Error Mitigation</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above picture, you can see the outcome of applying measurement error mitigation. On the left, the histogram shows results obtained using the device `ibmq_vigo`. The ideal result should have shown 50% counts $00000$ and 50% counts $10101$. Two features are notable here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, notice that the result contains a skew toward $00000$. This is because of energy relaxation of the qubit during the measurement process. The relaxation takes the $\\vert1\\rangle$ state to the $\\vert0\\rangle$ state for each qubit.\n",
    "- Second, notice that the result contains other counts beyond just $00000$ and $10101$. These arise due to various errors. One example of such errors comes from the discrimination after measurement, where the signal obtained from the measurement is identified as either $\\vert0\\rangle$ or $\\vert1\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The picture on the right shows the outcome of performing measurement error mitigation on the results. You can see that the device counts are closer to the ideal expectation of $500%$ results in $00000$ and $500%$ results in $10101$, while other counts have been significantly reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How measurement error mitigation works\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by creating a set of circuits that prepare and measure each of the $2^n$ basis states, where $n$ is the number of qubits. For example, $n = 2$ qubits would prepare the states $|00\\rangle$, $|01\\rangle$, $|10\\rangle$, and $|11\\rangle$ individually and see the resulting outcomes. The outcome statistics are then captured by a matrix $M$, where the element $M_{ij}$ gives the probability to get output state $|i\\rangle$ when state $|j\\rangle$ was prepared. Even for a state that is in an arbitrary superposition $|\\psi \\rangle = \\sum_j \\alpha_j |j\\rangle$, the linearity of quantum mechanics allows us to write the noisy output state as $|\\psi_{noisy}\\rangle = M |\\psi\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of measurement error mitigation is not to model the noise, but rather to apply a classical correction that undoes the errors. Given a noisy outcome, measurement error mitigation seeks to recover the initial state that led to that outcome. Using linear algebra we can see that given a noisy outcome $|\\psi_{noisy}\\rangle$, this can be done by applying the inverse of the matrix $M$, i.e., $|\\psi \\rangle = M^{-1} |\\psi_{noisy}\\rangle$.  Note that the matrix $M$ recovered from the measurements is usually non-invertible, thus requiring a generalized inverse method to solve.  Additionally, the noise is not deterministic, and has fluctuations, so this will in general not give you the ideal noise-free state, but it should bring you closer to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find a more detailed description of measurement error mitigation in [Chapter 5.2](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-quantum-hardware/measurement-error-mitigation.html) of the Qiskit textbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The goal of this exercise is to create a calibration matrix $M$ that you can apply to noisy results (provided by us) to infer the noise-free results.**\n",
    "\n",
